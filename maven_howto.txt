Maven is a command line build tool, which allows you to easily create release packages of your app and also to easily build your app on a build-server!

Windows only, I have no clue about Linux/Mac:

1) Download Maven: http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/maven/binaries/apache-maven-3.0.4-bin.zip
2) Unzip Maven
3) Add the bin/ folder inside maven to the path Variable
4) Make sure JAVA_HOME points to the JDK 7 !, e.g.: JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_02
5) in the root of our project, you can now simply call maven in the console with:
	mvn install
   This will create a target/ folder which contains a .zip file, which contains everything you need to run the application

AWESOME!
